# LitterBox

Static code analysis tool for detecting recurring bug patterns in Scratch projects. 

## Authors

See [Contributors](https://github.com/se2p/LitterBox/graphs/contributors)

## Usage

LitterBox can analyze a single project and produce console output for every single Issue.

Also, there is a method that takes a folder path as an input and analyzes all Json files in the directory. 
This method produces a csv file with all issue counts for every project.

Finally it is possible to download one or multiple projects and analyze those.

##
To use LitterBox with the command line, build the Jar with mvn clean and mvn package.

### Command Line Options:

1. path - the Scratch projects path or a folder path with multiple Scratch projects
2. projectid - id of the project that should be downloaded and analysed
3. projectlist - path to a file with a list of project ids of projects which should be downloaded and analysed.
4. projectout - path where downloaded projects should be stored
5. output - path to the csv file where the results of the analysis should be stored
6. detectors - all the detectors you want to run (short names separated by ","), if not set, all will be used

#### Example:

java -cp C:\ScratchAnalytics-1.0.jar de.uni_passau.fim.se2.litterbox.Main -path C:\scratchprojects\files\ -output C:\scratchprojects\files\test.csv -detectors mssLoopSens,blockCnt

This will run only Missing Loop Sensing and Block Count on all projects in C:\scratchprojects\files\; and it will also
 save the test.csv file in the same location.

## Extendability

First of all, create a new IssueFinder and implement the corresponding interface. 
The check() method must return a IssueReport with the issue name, count for the current project, 
the sprites of all issue occurrences and notes about the issue.
Then, register the newly created IssueFinder in the IssueTool constructor ( finder.add(new NewFinder()) ).
The finder name will automatically be added to the printed csv file.
